## What is this ???

A browser extension that only allows a single tab in a browser window.

In case you're really desperate to open a second tab, you can still open a
new browser window, or make use of a bug. In the latter case, a fix is very welcome.

## Disclaimer

This is "vibecoded" with Claude. I have created this extension to improve my focus. I claim that it works for me.
